# De novo assembly of virus reads

## Description

As a bioinformatician, I would like to generate a set of virus contigs from reads that have been identified as virus.

## Notes

- Input - set of fastq reads in one file (SE) or as two files in order

- Output - set of contigs in fasta format

Other thoughts

- add handling of input as fasta or BAM

## Estimate: 5
## Priority: MUST
