# Generate a Report from reads aligned to set of Refernce seqs

## Description

As a biologist, I would like to have a report file summarizing the results of the alignments to viral refseq. I need to know how many alignments found to each reference sequence and other metrics such as average score.

## Notes

- Input: BAM file

- Desired output: tsv file with one row per reference and several columns of metrics

Other things to think about

- what exactly does the user want in each column?
- what metrics does user want calculated?

## Estimate: 2
## Priority: MUST
