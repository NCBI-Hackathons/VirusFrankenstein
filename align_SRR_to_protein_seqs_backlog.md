# Determine set of SRR reads that align to Protein seqs

## Description

As a biologist, I'm interested in finding distant alignments to viruses in SRR using a set of reverse translated protein sequences

## Notes

- Input: SRR accession number (or [ED]RR)

- Output: BAM file of the read alignments to reference sequences

Other notes

- need to set more relaxed alignment parameters (i.e. don't penalize mismatches as much)
- which aligner to use?
	- need to ask the user

## Estimate: 2
## Priority: MUST
